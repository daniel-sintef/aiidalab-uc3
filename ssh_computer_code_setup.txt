**) I gave up on using ProxyJump was getting several different errors and (~2 hours effort)
1. raise valueerror("q must be exactly 160, 224, or 256 bits long") valueerror: q must be exactly 160, 224, or 256 bits long
   Bypassed by creating ed25519 key
2. disconnect (code 2 received packet inappropriate for current authentication state)
   No clue about htis this one, 
3. paramiko.ssh_exception.ChannelException: ChannelException(1, 'Administratively prohibited')
   No clue about this one

Meanwhile proxycommand worked with almost no effort... (~10 minutes)
